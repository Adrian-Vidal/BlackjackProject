# BlackjackProject

##Overview
- Create a blackjack game. Treat the dealer as a player so that he has his own hand. The hands are created inside he player class, dealer extends the player class so there is no need to add another hand inside the dealer class.
- Like in a real blackjack game, when the hands are presented, make sure the dealers second card is hidden. Once the hands are dealt and the player did not get blackjack, give the player the option to either hit or stand.
- Once the player chooses to stand or goes over 21, it is then the dealers turn. Dealer draws cards from the deck abiding by the rule of 17 (draw until the pass 17).
- Display the winner of each round (dealer or player).
