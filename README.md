# BlackjackProject

##Overview
- Create a blackjack game. Treat the dealer as a player so that he has his own hand. The hands are created inside the player class, dealer extends the player class so there is no need to add another hand inside the dealer class.
- Like in a real blackjack game, when the hands are presented, make sure the dealers first card is hidden. Once the hands are dealt and neither  player or dealer got blackjack, give the player the option to either hit or stand.
- Once the player chooses to stand, it is then the dealers turn. If player busts, dealer wins. Dealer draws cards from the deck abiding by the rule of 17 (draw until they pass 17).
- Display the winner of each round (dealer or player).

## Technologies used
- Java
- Eclipse
- GitHub
- Object oriented programming
- enum

## Lessons Learned
- How to incorporate enum into my program to set variables with predefined constants. A deck of cards has a set number and class of cards and you cannot add or make up your own cards, so enum works perfect for this situation.
